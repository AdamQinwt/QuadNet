# QuadNet
Inspired by quadratic functions, this project removes activation functions in neural networks by re-designing network operators.
The efficiency and effectiveness of QuadNet is only validated on the XOR problem and MNIST handwritten digit recognition problem.
## MNIST
- a3_conv_baseline.py
    * About 62k parameters
    * Top1/Top3=98.0/99.5
- a3_conv_2.py
    * About 14k parameters
    * Top1/Top3=98.5/99.5
